# Happiness Trends in Europe: A Data Visualisation Project (1973–2016)

## Introduction

With the development of society, people are paying more and more attention to mental health. The measurement of happiness is a very important part of the assessment of psychological states. In this project I look at how happiness has changed over time in Europe. I use survey data from the Eurobarometer study, which asks people in many European countries how happy they feel. The data have been processed and shared by Our World in Data. \[<https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy-eurobarometer>[ ](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy-eurobarometer)\]

I chose this topic because happiness is an important part of measuring the quality of life, but people often do not know how it changes over time or what differences exist among different countries. Some news reports or information on the Internet may mention that a certain country has a high level of happiness while another has a low level, but they often do not provide clear data. I wanted to make some simple visualisations that make these patterns easier to see.

The project also gave me a chance to practise the skills from this module. I use tidyverse functions to clean the data, create summary statistics, and draw different kinds of graphs. All of the code and data are kept together in one R project so that the results can be reproduced.

## Research questions

This project focuses on three main questions:

1\. **How has reported happiness changed over time in a selection of European countries?**\
Here I focus on several well-known countries (such as Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom) and look at long-term trends from 1973 to 2016.

2\. **Which countries have the highest average level of reported happiness across the whole period?**\
I calculate an average happiness score for each country and then look at the top ten.

3\. **Are there systematic differences in happiness between Northern and Southern Europe?**\
I group countries into “Northern Europe” and “Southern Europe” and compare the distribution of happiness scores between these two regions.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE, 
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE
)

library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate) 
library(gifski)   
happy_raw <- read_csv("data/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy-eurobarometer.csv")


names(happy_raw)
head(happy_raw)
```

## Data Origins

The data used in this project comes from the **Eurobarometer** survey. Eurobarometer is a long-running public opinion survey carried out for the European Commission. Every year, they go to various European countries to conduct surveys, understand people's evaluations of their own happiness levels and collect evidence.

The version of the dataset used here was cleaned and republished by **Our World in Data (OWID)**. OWID consolidated survey responses, standardized variable names, and made the data available as downloadable CSV files.This makes it possible to compare countries and time periods using one dataset.

The dataset used in this project contains the following key variables:\
**Codebook (main variables)**

| Variable        | Meaning                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Entity**      | The name of the country                         |
| **Code**        | Country’s short code (ISO code)                 |
| **Year**        | The year when the survey was collected          |
| **share_happy** | Percentage of people who reported being “happy” |

The dataset covers the years 1973 to 2016, but not every country has data for every year. Because the dataset comes from survey responses, some values are missing. In this project, rows with missing values in the share_happy column were removed.

Below is a preview of the raw data loaded into R:

```{r show-raw-data}
# Show raw data to illustrate structure
head(happy_raw)
```

## Data Preparation

Before making the visualisations, some basic cleaning steps were needed. The raw dataset contains a long variable name for happiness, so I first renamed it to a shorter and clearer name: share_happy. I also removed rows where the happiness value was missing, because these rows cannot be used in graphs or summary statistics.

In addition, I carried out some simple checks to make sure the data looked reasonable. Below are the main steps:

### 1. Renaming variables

The original happiness variable had a long name. Renaming it makes the code easier to read.

### 2. Removing missing values

Some country–year pairs do not have happiness data. These rows were removed so they do not distort the analysis.

### 3. Checking data ranges (sanity checks)

To make sure the values made sense, I checked: - **Year range:** The dataset should cover 1973–2016.\
- **Happiness range:** All values in `share_happy` should be between 0 and 100.\
- **Number of countries:** There should be many different countries represented.

All of these checks showed that the data looked consistent with the information given by Eurobarometer and Our World in Data.

### 4. Preview of the cleaned data

Below is a preview of the cleaned dataset:

```{r clean-data}
# Rename the long happiness column to a simpler name
happy_clean <- happy_raw %>%
  rename(
    share_happy = 'Share of people who are happy (Eurobarometer 2017)'
  ) %>%
  drop_na(share_happy) # Remove rows with missing values

#Display the cleaned data
head(happy_clean)
```

## Plot 1: Trends in happiness over time

### Interpretation of Plot 1

The animated figure (Plot 1-anim) shows how happiness changes year by year in seven European countries. Because the lines appear slowly over time, it is easier to notice when each country goes up or down. For example, in some years the line suddenly rises or drops, and the animation helps us see exactly when that happens. This makes the short-term changes more obvious, which is harder to notice in a static graph.

The static figure (Plot 1-trend) gives a clearer overview of the long-term pattern. I chose seven well-known countries so the lines would not be too crowded. As can be seen from the chart, these data points do not follow a single trend. Instead, most countries move up and down across the years. For example, Sweden stays at a very high level throughout almost the whole period, while Spain and Ireland start lower but show some noticeable increases later on. Germany and the United Kingdom also have more obvious fluctuations, especially around the 1980s and 1990s.

The static graph also includes a LOESS(LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) smooth line (the dashed black line). This line shows the average trend across all seven countries. After eliminating some of the interference caused by interannual fluctuations, the overall trend becomes more pronounced. The smooth line suggests that overall happiness in Europe stayed quite stable over the four decades, with a small increase after the early 2000s.

Together, the two plots help answer the first research question.\
The animated plot helps us see **when and how** happiness changed each year, while the static plot helps us understand the **overall pattern**. Although individual countries have their own ups and downs, the general trend across Europe remains fairly steady.

```{r Plot1-anim, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Plot1_trend_anim.gif")
```

```{r Plot1-trend, , fig.ext="gif"}
# Define the countries we want to focus on
countries_focus <- c(
  "Sweden", "Finland", "Ireland", 
  "United Kingdom", "Germany", "France", "Spain"
)

# These countries were filtered out from the cleaned data (happy_clean).
happy_focus <- happy_clean %>%
  filter(Entity %in% countries_focus)

# Static line chart of happiness over time
ggplot(happy_focus, aes(x = Year, y = share_happy, color = Entity)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.7) + # Draw a separate polyline for each country
  geom_point(size = 0.3, alpha = 0.7) + # Add small point to mark the observed values for each year, making the trend clearer.
  
  # Combined smoothed trend across all countries
  geom_smooth(
    aes(group = 1),
    method = "loess",
    se = FALSE,
    linewidth = 1.2,
    color = "black",
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  
  # Selecting and applying appropriate colors makes the image more readable.
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Sweden" = "#4A90E2", 
    "Finland" = "#FF8DAA", 
    "Ireland" = "#50C878",
    "United Kingdom" = "#BD10E0", 
    "Germany" = "#F5A623",
    "France" = "#4ECDC4",
    "Spain" = "#C44D58"
  )) + 
  
  # Set the x-axis years to a scale of 10 years.
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970, 2015, 10)) + 
  
  labs(
    title = "Life satisfaction trends in selected European countries (1973–2016)", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Share of people who are happy (%)", 
    color = "Country"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13), 
    axis.text  = element_text(color = "black"), 
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```

## Plot 2: Average happiness across countries

### Interpretation of Plot 2

This bar chart shows the ten countries with the highest average happiness across all the years in the dataset. I calculated the mean value for each country and then selected the top ten. Using a horizontal bar chart makes the names easy to read and helps compare the values.

From the plot, we can see that the top countries are mostly in Northern or Western Europe. Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland all have very high average scores. This matches common discussions about happiness in Europe, where countries in the north usually score well. Recent global findings support this pattern, as the World Happiness Report 2025 notes that the annual happiness rankings are once again led by Nordic countries, with Finland remaining in first place (Helliwell et al., 2025, p. 13). These figures are fairly close to one another, but the country with the highest value remains markedly higher than the rest.

These results answer the second research question: which countries had the highest average happiness levels over this long period? This chart shows that the countries with the highest average happiness levels between 1973 and 2016 were, in order: Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Belgium. This ranking is quite stable because the top-ranked countries have maintained high levels of happiness for many years.

```{r plot2-bar}
# Calculate the mean happiness for each country. 
happy_country_mean <- happy_clean %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%
  summarise(mean_happy = mean(share_happy, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_happy))

# Select the top 10 happiest countries.
happy_top10 <- happy_country_mean %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = mean_happy, n = 10)

# Plot bar chart.
ggplot(happy_top10, aes(x = reorder(Entity, mean_happy),y = mean_happy)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.85) + 
  
  # Flip axes so country names are easier to read.
  coord_flip() + 
  
  # Add value labels at the end of each bar.
   geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_happy, 1)),
            hjust = -0.1,
            size = 3) +
  # Keep y-axis within 0–100 and leave a bit of space for labels.
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100),
                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +

  
  # Choose the minimal theme. 
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 happiest countries (1973-2016 average)", 
    x = "Country", 
    y = "Average share happy (%)"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) + 
  # Make the country labels darker for better readability. 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16), 
      axis.text = element_text(color = "black"))
```

## Plot 3: Northern vs Southern Europe

### Interpretation of Plot 3

This boxplot compares the distribution of happiness levels in Northern Europe and Southern Europe.I grouped the countries into these two regions because this is a common way to describe cultural and economic differences within Europe (Hofstede, 2002). Using a boxplot is helpful here because it shows the range of the values, not just the average.

From the plot, Northern Europe has higher happiness scores overall and also less variation. Northern Europe's box is positioned higher on the y-axis and is more compact, which means that people there report higher and more consistent levels of happiness. In contrast, Southern Europe has a lower box and a wider spread, indicating lower average scores and greater fluctuation.

This plot answers the third research question by showing that there is a clear difference between the two regions. Northern European countries tend to report higher happiness levels across the whole period from 1973 to 2016, while Southern European countries show lower and more variable scores.

```{r Plot3-region-box}
#Plot 3: Trends in happiness by region (Northern vs Southern Europe)

# Define the regions to which each country belongs: Nordic Group and Southern European Group.
northern <- c("Sweden", "Finland", "Denmark", "Norway", "Iceland") 
southern <- c("Spain", "Italy", "Portugal", "Greece", "Cyprus")

# Create a new variable `region` to indicate whether a country belongs to Northern or Southern Europe.
happy_region_box <- happy_clean %>%
  mutate(
    region = case_when(
      Entity %in% northern ~ "Northern Europe", 
      Entity %in% southern ~ "Southern Europe",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_ # Other countries are marked as NA (this will be removed later).
    )
  ) %>%
  drop_na(region) # remove

# Create a boxplot. 
# Draw the boxplots for each region. 
ggplot(happy_region_box, aes(x = region, y = share_happy, fill = region)) + 
 geom_boxplot(width = 0.55, alpha = 0.8, outlier.shape = NA) +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("Northern Europe" = "#FF8DAA",
                               "Southern Europe" = "#74B9FF")) +
  
  # Set the y-axis range to avoid unnecessary blank spaces and make differences more obvious.
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30,100)) + 
  
  labs(
    title = "Happiness levels in Northern and Southern Europe", 
    subtitle = "Boxplot of happiness scores by region (1973-2016)", 
    x = "Region", 
    y = "Share of people who are happy (%)"
  ) + 
  
  # Choose the minimal theme.
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "none", 
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11), 
    axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

## Plot 4: Variation in happiness by country (standard deviation)

### Interpretation of Plot 4

This chart shows the magnitude of change in the happiness index of each country, measured by standard deviation. It helps us understand which countries are more stable over time and which ones experience larger swings in happiness.

To connect this graph with Plot 3, I used the same regional colours: pink for Northern Europe, blue for Southern Europe, grey for all other countries. This allows the reader to see whether the same patterns from Plot 3 also appear when we look at variation.

A clear pattern appears in the results. Most Southern European countries (in blue) have much higher levels of variation. Their bars extend further to the right, showing that their happiness levels changed a lot more from year to year. In contrast, Northern Europe (in pink) shows the lowest variation in the whole dataset. Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland all appear at the bottom of the graph with very small standard deviations.

This pattern matches what we saw in Plot 3: Northern Europe is not only happier on average, but their happiness is also more stable. Southern Europe does not only start lower on average, but their scores fluctuate more strongly over time. Countries in the grey “Other” category sit mostly in the middle, showing moderate variation. This also fits our analysis, because these countries belong to many different regions that were not part of the comparison in Plot 3. By keeping them in grey, the graph remains readable and avoids distracting the reader from the main comparison.Overall, the chart confirms the conclusions of the previous analysis, showing that regional differences across European countries are reflected not only in average levels of happiness, but also in the stability of happiness over time. Northern Europe stands out as both the happiest and the most stable region in the dataset.

```{r Plot4-standard deviation}
# Calculate standard deviation for each country. 
happy_sd <- happy_clean %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%
  summarise(sd_happy = sd(share_happy, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sd_happy))

# Add region info to match Plot 3 colours. 
happy_sd <- happy_sd %>%
  mutate(
    region = case_when(
      Entity %in% northern ~ "Northern Europe",
      Entity %in% southern ~ "Southern Europe",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  )
# Define consistent colours (same as Plot 3). 
region_colours <- c(
  "Northern Europe" = "#FF8DAA",   # pink
  "Southern Europe" = "#74B9FF",   # blue
  "Other" = "grey80"               # grey
)

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(happy_sd, aes(x = reorder(Entity, sd_happy), # Reorder the x-axis by standard deviation.
                     y = sd_happy,
                     fill = region)) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() + # Flipping the coordinates makes it easier to read country names.

  # Use the previously defined regional color scheme. 
  scale_fill_manual(values = region_colours) +

  labs(
    title = "Variation in happiness by country (standard deviation)",
    subtitle = "Northern and Southern Europe highlighted using the same colours as Plot 3",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Standard deviation of happiness (%)",
    fill = "Region"
  ) +

  # Use a minimal theme and adjust the font, margins, and gridlines.
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7.5),     # reduce crowding
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 40, 10, 10),       # more right space
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 15),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, color = "grey30"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() # Removing secondary grid lines makes the visual appearance cleaner.
  )
```

## Conclusion

To conclude, this report answered the three research questions using data from the Eurobarometer survey.

RQ1: **How has reported happiness changed over time in a selection of European countries?**\
From 1973 to 2016, overall happiness in European countries remained relatively stable, despite some minor fluctuations in certain years. The long-term trend line shows no significant increase or decrease in happiness throughout the period.

RQ2: **Which countries have the highest average level of reported happiness across the whole period?**\
The countries with the highest average happiness levels are mostly located in Northern or Western Europe, including Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Belgium.

RQ3: **Are there systematic differences in happiness between Northern and Southern Europe?\
**Yes. Figure 3 shows that Northern Europe has a higher average level of happiness with less interannual fluctuation, while Southern Europe has a lower average level of happiness with greater fluctuation. Figure 4 further confirms this finding, the standard deviation of the Nordic countries is also much smaller than that of the Southern European countries, which means that their happiness index is more stable over time.These two figures together demonstrate that the differences between the North and South are reflected not only in average happiness levels, but also in the long-term stability of these levels.

## Summary

This project helped me understand how different types of visualisations can show different sides of the same dataset. By working with Eurobarometer happiness data from 1973 to 2016, I learned how data cleaning, grouping and plotting choices can change the patterns we see. Using four visualisations allowed me to look at happiness from several angles instead of relying on one summary statistic.

The results reveal several clear trends. The line chart shows that the indices for Nordic countries have remained at a relatively high and stable level over the long term, while the indices for Southern European countries have fluctuated significantly year by year.The bar chart also shows that there are significant differences in average happiness levels, with Northern European countries once again ranking among the highest.The box plot also supports this view, showing that Southern Europe has a wider score range, indicating that the overall stability of the data in this region is poor.

The standard-deviation plot added an important extra perspective on these differences. It showed that Northern European countries not only have higher average happiness but also much lower variation, meaning their happiness levels remain stable across decades. In contrast, many Southern European countries highest standard deviations, confirming that their happiness scores fluctuate strongly over years. Together, these four visualisations show that the North–South contrast is not only about average levels of happiness, but also about how consistent those levels are over time.

There were still some limitations. Some countries have missing years, which influences the long-term trends. The dataset is based on self-reports, so cultural differences in how people describe happiness may affect the results. This data is also up to 2016. Due to the impact of COVID-19 in the following years, it became difficult for many countries to collect data, so the dataset was terminated till then.

If I continued this project, I would like to explore what factors explain these regional differences. Economic indicators, unemployment rates, or social inequality may help explain why some countries consistently rank at the top. It would also be interesting to compare Europe with other continents or to look at shorter time windows to see how specific events affect happiness. These steps could give a deeper understanding of what shapes happiness beyond simple averages.
