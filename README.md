# Happiness Trends in Europe: A Data Visualisation Project (1973–2016)

This project looks at how reported happiness has changed in Europe from 1973 to 2016. The data comes from the Eurobarometer surveys, which ask people in many European countries how happy they feel. The version I use was shared by Our World in Data. They combined the survey results, made the variable names easier to understand, and put everything into one dataset. More information about the data source can be found in the codebook.

At the beginning of the project, I explored all the countries and years in the dataset. Then I focused on a few key variables: the country name, the country code, the year of the survey, and the percentage of people who said they were happy. These were used to make four visualisations. The graphs show long-term trends, average happiness levels, and differences between Northern and Southern Europe.

The data, code, and original dataset can be found at this link: Eurobarometer; processed by Our World in Data (2023). Share of people who say they are happy. <https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy-eurobarometer>

The idea for this project came from my interest in how happiness changes and whether common beliefs about “happier countries” are true. Making the graphs helped me see these patterns more clearly. This project also allowed me to practise important skills from this module, such as data cleaning, grouping, and making different types of ggplot2 graphs.
